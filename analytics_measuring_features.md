# Measuring the Success of a Feature

https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/02/23/steps-measuring-feature/

A feature is born as an idea for solving a particular problem. Some problems are very clearly defined, while others are incredibly nebulous. The key is to define what this problem is solving for (to the best of your ability).

You'll want to think of the feature as this:

"By building feature_x, we will change metric_y by z%"

## 7 Step Framework

### Step 1: Measure basic usage of the new feature

Are people using the feature?

* Total number of times people are using the feature (Amplitude - Total Event Count)
* The number of unique users who are using the feature (Amplitude - Unique users performing event)

* The percentage of your total active users who are using the feature (Amplitude - % of daily active users performing the event)
* The average number of times per day users are using the feature

### Step 2: Dig deeper into event properties to look for patterns

What type of notifications are users clicking on?

What type of users are clicking on notifications?

What patterns of behavior do they exhibit?

What common attributes do these users have?

### Step 3: Understand what users are doing right before using the feature


What are most users doing right before they perform an event? 

This gives you an idea of the context in which they’re using your new feature.

#### Examples

##### Signup Event
* What page do users sign up on? 

##### Click notification event
* How long do users wait before opening the menu?

##### Leave a one liner event
* How do users arrive at the page they leave the one liner on?
* Do they click on a weekly digest link we sent?
* Do users that leave a one liner already have the service they leave the one liner on in one of their stacks?

### Step 4: Build a behavioral cohort of people who used the feature to analyze how they compare to your overall user population

### Step 5: Analyze the impact of the new feature on retentition

You can compare the retention of the cohort of users created in step 4 who performed an event. 

One way to do this is to look specifically at new user retention: 

Do new users who add a one liner in their experience (like their first day), retain better than new users who don’t add a one liner?

### Step 6: Measure the impact of the new feature on your key conversion funnels.

We need to define the conversion funnels we want to track.

### Step 7: Measure the impact of your new feature on engagement

#### Average number of sessions each user does per day.

Does the cohort of users that leave a one liner have more sessions per day than the users that do not leave a one liner?

#### ‘stickiness’ of users who perform an event

Stickiness as the percentage of users who are active at least n days out of a week.

Do users who add a one liner use the app on more days per week that uers that don't add a one liner. 

**Example:** 45% of users that add a one liner use your app every day in a week, compared to 27% of users that dont add a one liner.

## Example Implementation

1. Signup Event
2. Click notification event
3. Leave a one liner
