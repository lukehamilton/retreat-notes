# Retreat Notes

* Update this https://gist.github.com/lukehamilton/9eb34d79fab3d47a1ea1813924410c89
	* Well some of the stuff you did so maybe take that out
	* Now that you're more familiar with the product and some of our goals maybe update some of the ideas or add? 
* Prepare something to discuss on
	* How we can start to quantitatively track the impact of new features via analytics (i.e. Feature X resulted in 5% more clicks on this page, Feature Y resulted in 15% longer time spent on average on this page, etc…)

* Lead some meditation sessions in the mornings

3. Luke to lead discussion on how we can start to quantitatively track the impact of new features via analytics (i.e. Feature X resulted in 5% more clicks on this page, Feature Y resulted in 15% longer time spent on average on this page, etc…).
