### Components

We already have some of this in an existing Trello board.

#### 1. Backlog

This is where all the ideas are dumped. This doc is a spreadsheet, and contains the experiment name, status, category (area you’re trying to improve), metric, prediction, and a resource estimate of how much time it will take marketing, engineering, design, and anybody else.

#### 2. Pipeline

The list of experiments past, present, and future. 
All past experiments have their results documented. This allows new team members a chance to go back and look at every experiment to show how they got to where they are today.

#### 3. Experiment Docs

This is the most important document out of the four. Every experiment gets one of these. This document forces the team to think through the important elements of the experiment. When going through this document, they have to think about why they’re doing this experiment vs the others, what they expect from the experiment, how they’re going to design and implement the experiment, and record the learnings.

#### 4. Playbooks

If an experiment is successful, they try to figure out ways to systematize them. They’re step-by-step guides for things they want to repeat.

**Example:** Glenn's HN hack
